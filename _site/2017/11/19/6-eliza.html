        <h2 id="the-parts">The Parts</h2>
<h3 id="wood">Wood</h3>
<p>Most of the wood is a marine plywood which is precisely cut to spec by a CNC machine at CLC Boats headquarters. The planking is 6mm okoume plywood throughout, with three 9mm frames and seats. The outwhales are two layers each of solid mahogany and there are two cypress rubbing strips of the bottom.</p>

<h3 id="epoxy">Epoxy</h3>
<p>The epoxy included in the kit is a no-blush two-part epoxy. In addition to the resin and the hardener a bin of carb-o-sil (thickener) and of wood flour were included. This made up a significant amount the final cost of the kit at 1/5. Lucky for me (and my friends’ whose basement was a major workshop) this epoxy is very human friendly. There are almost no vapors coming of the epoxy when mixing or drying and the mixture has extremely low flammability. This epoxy is a 100% solids formulation which means that no material (and thickness for that matter) is lost through the drying process. Additionally this means that there are no evaporating volatile organic compounds (VOCs). This epoxy is great because it is safe to use, but it is also awesome because the final product requires less coats.</p>

<h3 id="primepaint">Prime/Paint</h3>
<p>I went with Chesapeake Light Craft’s recommendation on both primer and paint, purchased at West Marine. For primer I went with Interlux Pre-Kote in White (4279). Pre-Kote was designed to be used with one-part polyurethane marine paints, such as the Brightside line of paints. It is a high build and easily sanded primer, which theoretically should allow for an exceptionally smooth foundation for the paint. I used Interlux Brightside in the Hatteras Off-White (4208) color. The Brightside line of paint is known for being glossy, durable, and easy to use. Most recommend it be rolled on and tipped shortly after. This paint contains Teflon® which makes easy to clean, abrasion resistant, and very difficult to remove from human skin.</p>

<h3 id="varnish">Varnish</h3>
<p>Again I chose and Interlux product as a result of the Chesapeake Light Craft advice. I chose Interlux Schooner varnish.</p>

<h2 id="the-build">The Build</h2>
<p>I built much of the boat in Julia Meyer’s furnace room. Her roommates have kindly agreed to let me use the space. After ruling out the RiverWest workshop I planned on building the boat in my living room. My roommates vetoed that option, and Julia swooped in to save the day. As to be expected for such a project, my estimate for time of completion was horribly off.  This resulted in need to move the boat once I had overstayed my welcome. The build occurred in three places–Julia’s furnace room, a small storage unit, and the backyard of a duplex I once lived in. I bought an 10’ x 8’ UV resistant (“blocking” they say) to prevent UV damage to the epxy, to keep of the rain, and to fend of aviary droppings.</p>

<h3 id="stitching">Stitching</h3>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">5 hours</code></p>

<p>All of the stitching happened in one day. It took approximately 5 hours stitch all of the planks. I had the help of two friends, Julia and Ian, which surely halved the amount of time this step took. The first planks became gradually easy to stitch up as the boat took its shape. As recommended in the instructions we put the epoxy kit in the middle of the center panel, bowing the piece significantly. This made it much easier to put the planks on. By the time we put the transoms on everything was a bit loose. It seemed as though we had done something wrong–the planks didn’t fit in the grooves of the transom. After wiring the transoms on to the five planks the other four planks were stitched on. It was still the case that the planks fit sloppily in the grooves of the transom. I did notice that picking the boat up up by either end enhanced the alignment. It is my suspicion that the boat was simply not bowed enough at this stage. Only 6 hours prior it had been a pile a flat pieces of plywood! We piled a bit more weight in to the center of the boat and left it on the sawhorses overnight. After stitching the last plank on we fitted the middle piece in and stitched it up. The initial stitch up was done.</p>

&amp;lt;/gallery&amp;gt;</code></p>

<h3 id="hull-gluing">Hull Gluing</h3>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">5 hours</code></p>

<p>I came back the next day to start the gluing. I first flipped the boat over and back on to the sawhorses. I was surprising how rigid it had become. I found the boat but more easily persuaded in to fitting in the grooves. I attribute this to both the overnight bending and the upside-down orientation of the boat. To glue, I first had to tighten all of the stitches. I found the planks to fit quite nicely (and tightly!) into the grooves of the transoms. This was very gratifying! I mixed the two-part epoxy for what was probably a too-short amount of time, gradually adding the carb-o-sil as I stirred. When I had reached what seemed to be a thick mustard like consistency I went to work sucking it up with the syringe and apply it to the overlap. After I had finished two lines the mixture had thickened to the point of being very difficult to suck up with the syringe. I mixed a new batch of epoxy and went back to work. This also thickened significantly and I had to stop after two seams. The application is surely not pretty but I think it will do the job. I glued paired planks so the structure will cure symmetrically.</p>

<p>I came back the next day to finish the gluing of the planks. To make gluing easier, I mixed the epoxy so that it was thinner. This was a bad idea. I had pretty major leakage from one of the seams. I finished up this seam the best that I could. This took a whole batch of epoxy (probably because it was all coming out through the seam!). I mixed a new batch, this time thicker, and finished a seam and a half with no issues. I went back and tightened the leaky seam, then added the thicker epoxy to it. This stuck well enough and after wiping drippings from earlier, I saw no more dripping. I finished up the other seams, taped the ends of the seams to prevent a "drainage" effect of the epoxy which would have resulted in large drips down the transoms, and called it a night.</p>

<p>I came back a week later ready to do the fillets. I was, however, ill prepared. I didn’t have what I need to do the fillets (tape, bags, gloves, acetone) so I decided I would prep the boat for fillets and come back soon. The boats was considerably stiffer that when it was just stitched. It had much less flex. I flipped the boat on the sawhorses, no issues at this point! The prep ended up taking longer than I thought it would have. This was the process of un-stitching the boat. It was quite satisfying clipping all of the copper stitches Ian, Julia, and I had painstakingly tightened weeks prior. The transom stitched remained. The shape held and I was excited to keep going with the gluing! At this point the planks were glued up but the transoms were not.</p>

<p>A few days passed and I was back again, this time with all of the supplies I need to fillet. I decided to remove the transom stitched because the epoxy from the planks had almost completely fixed them in place. I was careful not nudge them too much however. I left three stitches in the stern transom because the epoxy hadn’t quite fixed those locations. I began by taping the future fillet locations off with blue painters tape. This took a ton of time! I then mixed epoxy with carb-o-sil and wood flour to peanut butter consistency. I put this mixture into a gallon size ziplock bag, nipped the corner, and got to placing the mixture in the transom seams. I filletted the seams with a fantastically shaped wooden stick that I found in a pack of 40 at a thrift store. After this I repeated the process (but foregoing the painters tape) of seam filletting for the planks 1 seams. I removed the tape soon after finishing up the fillets. Next is fiberglassing!</p>

<h3 id="fiberglassing">Fiberglassing</h3>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">6 hours</code></p>

<p>The fillets were definitely dry by now (a week late) and I was satisfied with how they turned out. I removed the three stitched that I had to leave in the week prior without any problems. There are two sections of fiberglass applied to the boat. The first step was to glass the interior if the boat, the second the bottom of the boat. I would have thought that the entire interior would be glassed. Instead, only the bottom panel and the first planks were covered in cloth and wetted out. During this session I spent about 25 minutes taping off the second planks. My practice last week made me quicker on the draw with the tape. I mixed up 2 cups of epoxy, laid out the cloth, and began pouring the epoxy slowly on to the cloth. Using a squegee I spread the epoxy around and saturated the cloth, being sure the not leave it too wet. The weave is supposed to still be visible after the first application of epoxy to the cloth.Once I reached the end of the boat I was a bit short on epoxy so I mixed up another small batch and finished up. This step went without issues and was satisfying to finish! I decided to let this application dry for 4 days before I flipped the boat to do the underside. I trimmed the excess fiberglass cloth that was not attached to the wood. I flipped the boat and repeated the above process on the bottom of the boat. I mixed up some fresh un-thickened epoxy and worked the epoxy in using a squegee. Another 4 days of drying.</p>

<h3 id="internal-frames">Internal Frames</h3>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">3 hours</code></p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;lt;!-- [[File:divider1.JPG | frameless | 150px | right | Second planks taped off]]  --&amp;gt;</code></p>

<p>This was a straight-forward job. I had to wait until the fiberglass on the inside of the boat was completed. I then dry-fit the internal frames, using pre-drilled holes to determine the correct positions. I sanded the bow frame because it did not fit perfectly. I then used the same filleting techniques that I used previously to affix the frames. I mixed up a batch of epoxy, added lots of wood flour and a wee bit of cab-o-sil to smooth it out. I put all of this in a large ziplock and applied the mixture like one would apply frosting. I then went back and used my filletting tool to push the mixture in to the seams as well as to form a desirable, sloping shape. I cleaned up the squeeze-out with a paint scraper.</p>

<h3 id="outwhales">Outwhales</h3>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">2 hours</code>
This was a crucial step. With the help of a friend I glued on the outwhales. I used 2 strips of mahogany for each side. I had to acquire a ton of clamps before undertaking this task. I had 6 on hand and bought 20 more. The new clamps I bought permit up to 2 inches of clamping material, more than enough for this application. I couldn’t have done this without a friend. I mixed a fresh batch of un-thickened epoxy. I first glued the two strips together, then, while still wet, I spread epoxy on the receiving surface of the boat and began clamping. I started at the bow and affixed a tight clamp. Ian held the bow end of the strips as I worked my way to the back, clamping approximately every 8 inches. Due to the steps leading up to the final clamping, and the time it took to clamp, we had to keep up a quick pace. Immediately after finalising the positions of the clamps we wiped up all of the squeezed out epoxy.</p>

<p>I feared the clamps would be difficult to remove because of how messy the the job was. To my surprise, I had no issues getting the off! As far as I can tell the small amount of epoxy that got on the threads of the clamps is not a problem. Each time I add applied somewhere on this boat, it noticeably stiffens. The effect of the outwhales on the stiffness has been the most pronounce change. It barely bends when I roll it over by myself!</p>

&amp;lt;/gallery&amp;gt;</code></p>

<h3 id="skegs--skids">Skegs &amp; Skids</h3>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">2 hours</code></p>

<p>We flipped the boat over to expose its underbelly. I drew a centerline on the bottom of the boat. I drilled holes from the outside along the part of the boat that the skeg would sit. When we were ready to install the skeg, I mixed up a batch of epoxy thickened with wood flour and applied it the the mating surfaces. While a friend held the skeg along the centerline installed four screws through the bottom of the boat in to the skeg from underneath. I then applied a large fillet the the skeg and the bottom boat. The skeg was not perfectly fair, so I had to devise a simple prop to keep it perfectly vertical while the epoxy dried.</p>

<p>The skids came next. Using the plans as a rough guide and a bit of eye-balling, I decided on a position for the skids. I bent them to them bottom of the boat and traced their positions. Like with the skeg I drilled holes from the outside first, using the tracings as guides for screw position. Once we were ready to screw the skids into position I mixed up another batch of epoxy thickened with wood flour and applied it to the mating surfaces. Using the help of a friend again I screwed the skids in from underneath with four screw per skid. I did not place the aft screw as far aft as it could have been which causes the aft tip of the skid to be slightly raised. I filled this small gap with the woody epoxy.</p>

<h3 id="seat-and-doubler-installation">Seat and Doubler Installation</h3>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">5 hours</code></p>

<p>This step was a little bit strung out. Before the actual installation I coated both the ballast compartments and the undersides of the seats. Once these were fully dried, I went on to install the seats.</p>

<p>After I had acquired a storage unit, and a bit of fresh air for Eliza, I finally got around to installing the seats. I used a sander the slightly modify the shapes of the seat to rest correctly in the boat. I then filletted the seats in. It sounds simple, but this part was probably the roughest of the entire build. I think it had something to do with the temperature that day, and also maybe trying to maneuver around my 7’9” x 4’ boat in a 10’ x 5’ room. The epoxy kept running through the seam of the seat and the wall of the boat. The seat also kept moving slightly, disrupting the smooth fillett so carefully moulded moments before. I also forgot to fillet under the seats and had to return to this the next workday.</p>

<p>Once the seats were secured it was time to install the transom and bow doublers. I want to leave the option of using a motor on this little dinghy so I decided to install the non-intrusive pad on the transom. All of these pieces were loaded with unthickened epoxy and clamped to hell in the respective locations.  I didn’t have a deep-throated clamp for clamping the bottom of the doublers nor the motorpad. Using a file and a tongue depressor on the motor pad I was able to extend the effect of the clamp vertically and downward. For the doublers, I filled a few buckets with sand and leaned them up against the doublers.</p>

<h3 id="sanding">Sanding</h3>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">15 hours</code></p>

<p>This is a bit of a catch all section. I scraped off erroneous epoxy, such as runs and drops, with the use of a very sharp chisel. It came off much easier than I had imagined. As you will noticed in previous photos, the planks and the outwhales jutted out past the transom and bow. Used a very cool Japanese pull saw to get a flush cut. there was some chipping but intend to round the edges anyways, so this won’t pose much of a problem. Next I filled any holes in the boat with some epoxy thickened with wood flour. This included every single one of the holes used during the stitching stage, as well as some minor gaps between the planks and the transom and bow.</p>

<p>I allowed the filler epoxy to dry then got to sanding. I removed a lot of material, both epoxy and wood. It is all a blur, but I do remember it was horrible.Hot, loud, and no slear indication of progress. I sanded and only sanded for at least 8 workdays, smoothing where the laps join the transom and bow, sanding the mahogany rubrails, sanding the fiberglass, smoothing the filletts, etc.</p>

<p>Anywhere to be painted only got the 80 grit treatment. Anywhere to be varnished got the 120 grit treatment.</p>

<h3 id="epoxify">Epoxify</h3>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">2 hours</code></p>

<p>After all of this sanding, I went ahead and rolled epoxy of every surface that remembered existed. Twice. I used unthickened epoxy, a roller, and a foam brush. My aim was to get two coats–which I nearly achieved. My bottle of hardener kicked the bucket during the second coating. Luckily I had almost finished, and would comfortably say I got 1.8 coats of epoxy on the boats.</p>

<h3 id="paint">Paint</h3>
<p>Another bout of sanding the epoxy I just rubbed all over my recently sanded wood. I sand the part to be painted with 80 grit thoroughly. It’s much easier when the task is smaller than sanding the entire boat. After the sanding, a wipe down, and some taping comes the primer. I roll it on, make sure the spread it into the overlaps with the foam brush, and manage to have only several runs of goopy primer that are too tacky to spread.</p>

<p>Finally time to paint! Oops, forgot. Have to sand the primer. The primer gets the 120 grit treatment. Now on with the paint!</p>

<h3 id="oars">Oars</h3>

<h3 id="mishaps">Mishaps</h3>
<p>The build started off on the wrong foot. When I received the kit I found that both outwhales on one side of the box were broken. Luckily I caught the delivery guy before he left. We documented the damage and he went on his way. CLC was very helpful and sent me replacement outwhales.</p>
