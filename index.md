# Hello
### My name is Kohl Kinning. I am...

...a bioinformatics analyst with the [Crnic Institute for Down Syndrome](http://www.trisome.org/) at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. Our aim is to leverage multi-omics data from the largest cohort of individuals with Down Syndrome yet to gain insight in to the underlying causes of health problems experienced by these people. Further, to put action to what we learn to help lessen the negative impacts of these health problems of people with and without Down Syndrome alike. It's my charge to sift through genetic, metabolic, microbial, immune, and many other data modalities and see how they affect a person's health in the context of trisomy 21.
