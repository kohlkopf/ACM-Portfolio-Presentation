# Hello
### My name is Kohl Kinning. I am...

...a bioinformaticist in the [Yu Lab](https://ron-yu-lab.github.io) research group at the Stowers Institute for medical research. Our aim is to explore and understand sensory systems and the processing of sensory information in the brain and it's my task to sift through big data associated with transcriptomics, genomics, and neural activation. I've recently been involved with a project involving a computer vision framework useful for examining neural activation in the entire organ.
