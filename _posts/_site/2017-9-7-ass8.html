<p><strong>KEGG Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and Visualization of RNA-seq data</strong></p>

<p>The first goal of this exercise is to test for KEGG Pathways that are enriched for
genes with divergent expression patterns between two experimental groups.
Secondly, we will visually represent high dimensional RNA-seq data in
meaningful ways, including ordination (non-metric multidimensional scaling) and
heatmaps organized by gene- and sample-wise clustering. We will also perform a
simple statistical test for multivariate differences in transcriptome composition
between two experimental groups</p>

    <tr>
      <td>####1</td>
      <td>Read in the edgeR differential gene expression results for pipefish and format KEGG pathway information</td>
    </tr>

</table>

<p>Read in the edgeR results, but note that this file contains a lot of other information. For our purposes now, we really only care about the “ko_ID” and “logFC” fields, which are KEGG gene orthology assignments for pipefish genes and log2 fold change values (fold change here is pregnant mean / non-pregnant mean), respectively.</p>
